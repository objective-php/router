# Config directives in objective-php/router 

## ObjectivePHP\Router\Config\UrlAlias

UrlAlias


**KEY:** router.url-alias **TYPE:** Multi Scalar  **|** Ignore Default 

These aliases are used by the PathMapperRouter. When a requested path matches an alias key,
PathMapperRouter will try to find the action matching the alias.

This is useful to alias '/' to '/home' (done by default byu objective-php/application), but it can also
help handling action moving for instance, or even small SEO concerns: if you only have a few public pages,
you can use aliases to handle multilingual paths (alias '/contactez-nous' => '/contact-us')


```json  
{
    "router.url-alias": {
        "/real-path": "/aliased"
    }
}
```
## ObjectivePHP\Router\Config\ActionNamespace

ActionNamespace


**KEY:** router.action-namespace **TYPE:** Multi Scalar  

The action namespaces are used by the default PathMapperRouter to find action classes matching request path.

In the ObjectivePHP Starter Kit, the default action namespace is ```Project\Action``` located in ```app/src/Action``` .
This means that PathMapperRouter will test the existence of a class which name is formed with the action namespace and the request path:

For a request path being ```/admin/users/list-all```, and using the default action namespace, the PathMapperRouter will
look for a class named ```Project\Action\Admin\Users\ListAll```. IF it exists, the PathMapperRouter will consider it can
route the request, and will set set ListAll class as middleware in charge of handling the request.


```json  
{
    "router.action-namespace": {
        "api-actions": "Project\Api\Action"
    }
}
```
